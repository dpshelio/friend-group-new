# A group of friends

We will use this repository to see different ways of representing a group of
friends and acquaintances in Python.

# The setting

Work with a partner to design a data structure to represent a group of
acquaintances using dictionaries and lists.
- Each person in the group has a name.
- Each person in the group has an age.
- Each person in the group can have a job.
- Each person can be connected to others in different ways, such as "friend", "granddaughter", "colleague" etc.

Think about how you want to represent the various types of information and the connections between them.

# Part 1
Create an example instance, in an editor or a notebook, of a structure for this group:
- Jill is 26, a biologist and she is Zalika's friend and John's partner.
- Zalika is 28, an artist, and Jill's friend
- John is 27, a writer, and Jill's partner.
- Nash is 34, a chef, John's cousin and Zalika's landlord.

Some things you may wish to consider in your model:
- Does it allow people who have no job?
- Does it allow people with no connections?
- Does it assume that connections are always reciprocal (e.g. if A is B's friend, does B
automatically consider A a friend too?)
